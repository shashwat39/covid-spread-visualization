# COVID Spread Visualization with Julia

The COVID Spread Visualization project utilizes the Julia programming language to create interactive visualizations of the spread of COVID infections. By leveraging the fast computation capabilities of Julia, the project aims to provide insightful visualizations and analyses of COVID infection data. Additionally, the project incorporates various topics from probability and stochastics to enhance the understanding of the infection spread dynamics.

## Features

- Real-time data visualization: Visualize the spread of COVID infections in real-time through interactive graphs and charts.
- Infection modeling: Utilize mathematical models to simulate the spread of infections and analyze different scenarios.
- Probability analysis: Implement probabilistic techniques to assess the likelihood of infection transmission and analyze risk factors.
- Stochastic simulations: Employ stochastic processes to model uncertainties in the infection spread and evaluate their impact.
- Uses Jupyter notebook enabling a smooth user experience


## Technologies Used

- Julia: A high-performance programming language for scientific computing and data analysis.
- Graphing libraries: Utilize Julia's graphing libraries, such as `Plots.jl` and `Interact`, to create interactive visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text.

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
- Install Julia: Download and install the latest version of Julia from the official Julia website.
- Install Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install jupyter`.
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-spread-visualization.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd covid-spread-visualization`
- Launch Jupyter Notebook: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the command `jupyter notebook`.
- Open the project notebook: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate the project notebook (e.g., `covid_visualization.ipynb`) and click on it to open it.
- Run the notebook: Inside the Jupyter Notebook, select `Run All` or execute the cells one by one to run the project and visualize the COVID spread.
